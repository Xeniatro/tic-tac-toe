Game rules:
1.  A 'round' is one game of tic tac toe. 
    In order for a player to win the whole game, they need to win 'b' amount of rounds.
    'b' is defined at the start of the game and is up to the players to decide.

2.  The player who goes first in a round is assigned to 'x' and the other player is assigned to 'o'.

3.  Every round, the player who goes first switches.

4.  When a player is prompted to make a move on the board, they enter a number from 1 to 9 that corresponds to the board shown:
     === === ===
    | 1 | 2 | 3 |
     === === ===
    | 4 | 5 | 6 |
     === === ===
    | 7 | 8 | 9 |
     === === ===
     
5.  Enter 'restart' at any point during a round to restart that specific round. (This is meant for input errors.)

6.  Enter 'quit' at any point during a round to end the entire game. A winner will then be announced.

7.  After each round, players are prompted if they would like to keep playing or not. If players select no,
    the game will end and a winner will then be announced.


Tic Tac Toe rules:
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. The two players are assigned to mark 'x' or mark 'o'. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
